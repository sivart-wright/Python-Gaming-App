<h1> Python Gaming Reservation App</h1>
<br>
<p> This Python application allows users to rent pool tables by the minute. I built this with Python because of the elegance, power, and simplicity of its syntax. Using Python allowed me to create an extremely versatile and easily-customized application that would be useful to a variety of clients and stakeholders. In fact, an application like this can be used for services that rent anything by the hour, and represents an example not only of the usefulness of Python's clean and readable syntax for teams but also its utility for building scalable applications that meet a variety of needs. </p>
